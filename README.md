# PowerBattle

I wrote this game on Amiga in the early 1990s using BlitzBasic 2.

## Original

### Amiga binaries

See <https://aminet.net/package/game/strat/PowerBattle>

### Source

See <https://github.com/tksuoran/PowerBattle/blob/master/8037.txt> for original sources.

## C++ update

I have started converting this to C++ but that progress is very slow and not likely to go anywhere fast.
